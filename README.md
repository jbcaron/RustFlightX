## Introduction

Welcome to the Rust Autonomous Drone Project repository. This open-source project aims to develop an autonomous drone system for a 2-meter wingspan motor glider using Rust as the programming language. The drone is designed to be controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller with RTOS, providing an affordable and flexible solution for hobbyists and drone enthusiasts.

## Project Overview

The project is a comprehensive exploration of drone development, covering various aspects of autonomous flight. The main objectives of this project include:

- [ ] Sensor Telemetry: Integration of a variety of sensors, such as a 3-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass), barometer, GPS, and a Time-of-Flight (TOF) Lidar laser for ground distance measurements.

- [ ] Sensor Data Filtering: Implementing filtering algorithms to enhance the accuracy and reliability of sensor data.

- [ ] Real-Time Telemetry: Establishing real-time communication between the drone and a remote ground station for monitoring and control.

- [ ] PCB Prototyping: Design and fabrication of custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for precise control of the drone's axes and sensor data acquisition.

- [ ] Axis Regulation: Developing control algorithms for axis stabilization and precision approach to the runway.

- [ ] Full Autonomy: Enabling the drone to navigate autonomously by following GPS waypoints, providing a high level of flexibility and utility.

## Project Stages

The project is structured into multiple stages to ensure a methodical development process:

1. Sensor Telemetry
In this stage, we will focus on integrating the various sensors into the drone. The sensors include:

   - A 3-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for attitude and orientation sensing, which includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass.
   - A barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure to estimate altitude.
   - A GPS module for global positioning information.
   - A Time-of-Flight (TOF) Lidar laser for precise ground distance measurement.

2. Sensor Data Filtering
To ensure reliable sensor data, we will implement filtering algorithms in this stage. Filtering will help reduce noise and errors in the sensor measurements, ultimately improving the drone's performance.

3. Real-Time Telemetry
This stage involves establishing real-time communication between the drone and a ground station using radio transmission. This communication allows for remote monitoring and control of the drone during flight.

4. PCB Prototyping
Custom PCBs will be designed and fabricated for controlling the drone's axes and acquiring sensor data. The PCBs provide a robust and tailored solution for our drone's specific needs.

5. Axis Regulation
In this stage, we will develop control algorithms to regulate the drone's axes, ensuring stability during flight and precise approaches to the runway.

6. Full Autonomy
The final stage of the project aims to achieve full autonomy for the drone. Using GPS waypoints, the drone will navigate autonomously, following a predefined path.

## Sensors

Our drone is equipped with various sensors that play a crucial role in its functionality:

- **9-axis IMU**: This sensor provides data from an accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass, enabling the drone to determine its attitude, orientation, and heading.

- **Barometer**: The barometer measures atmospheric pressure, allowing the drone to estimate its altitude and make necessary adjustments during flight.

- **GPS**: The GPS module provides precise global positioning data, essential for navigation and waypoint following.

- **Lidar (TOF)**: A Time-of-Flight Lidar laser is used to measure ground distances with high accuracy, assisting the drone in terrain following, obstacle avoidance, and landing.

## Hardware

The choice of hardware, specifically the ESP32 microcontroller with RTOS, is essential to the success of this project. Additionally, custom PCBs will be designed to facilitate the control of the drone's axes and sensor data acquisition.
